                Hello! This is my introductory website where I will tell you about myself. My name is Lake LeJeune (if you have not gotten that already from the header) and this is my second semester here at OTC. 
                I am currently undergoing the Computer Information Science two-year course. To be honest I just want a career where programming is involved with a good salary. Preferably one where I can work from home. 
                I struggle with learning code but remember it easily once I have a good understanding of how it works. Just in case I keep a notes page on my phone consisting of examples for each tag ithin the conding languages I know. 
                Overall I do enjoy coding but it is personally difficult for me to understand. Here is a table shwoing the different programming languages I know and my proficiency level with them:
                </p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Language</th>
                        <th>Proficiency</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>HTML5</td>
                        <td>Intermediate</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>CSS3</td>
                        <td>Intermediate</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Javascript</td>
                        <td>Beginner</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>C#</td>
                        <td>Intermediate</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>
                    I have a very broad range of interests spanning from outdoor recreational activities to playing videogames in my man cave of a bedroom. Here is a list of everything that interests me:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bushcraft</li>
                    <li>Homesteading</li>
                    <li>Overlanding</li>
                    <li>Locksmithing</li>
                    <li>Cooking</li>
                    <li>Programming (of course)</li>
                    <li>Computer Hardware</li>
                    <li>Automechanics</li>
                    <li>Gunsmithing</li>
                    <li>Blacksmithing</li>
                    <li>Woodworking</li>
                    <li>Knives</li>
                    <li>Videogames</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I more specifically enjoy the first five a LOT more than the rest, especially bushcraft. Due to the majority of these interests being indoors or expensive, I particularly like bushcraft due to it being inexspensive and easy to do.
